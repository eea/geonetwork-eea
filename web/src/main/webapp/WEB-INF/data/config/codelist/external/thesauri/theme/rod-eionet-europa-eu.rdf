    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">An international programme for routine transboundary monitoring with regular reporting to the coordinating body is in place (Trans National Monitoring Network). The objectives of the TNMN are to support reliable and consistent trend analysis of concentration loads for priority pollutants, support the assessment of water quality and use, and assist in the identification of major pollution sources. The specific requirements of the TNMN are to include sediment biomonitoring and quality control, be compatible with other major international river basins in Europe, and to comply with standards used in the western part of Europe. Further, the TNMN has been adapted to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (Article 8) in the end of 2008. Therefore, all types of monitoring and relevant parameters are covered by the monitoring network including all WFD Biological Quality Elements.
A Danube Pollution Reduction Programme was conducted during 1997 to 1999.
The Danube Regional Project (DRP) planned for 2001-2006 is actually one of three components of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Partnership for Nutrient Reduction in the Danube / Black Sea Basin. One of the goals is the reinforcement of monitoring, evaluation and information systems to control transboundary pollution, and to reduce nutrients and harmful substances.See for more information: http://www.icpdr.org/undp-drp/ and http://www.iwacportal.org/File/downloads/transboundary_rivers_europe/FrontPage.htm chapter 3.2</skos:definition>

Data Providers are requested to use the WISE-5 reporting in order to keep updated the spatial reference data relevant for the different WISE SoE reporting obligations. 
Data must be submitted as full data sets (no incremental updates).As of 2015, this reporting obligation includes all the WISE spatial reference data previously reported annually under the following reporting obligations:
- River quality (EWN-1): http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/28
- Lake quality (EWN-2): http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/29
- Groundwater quality (EWN-3): http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/30
- State &amp; Quantity of Water Resources (EWN-4): http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/184

Furthermore it allows the voluntary submission of updates to the WISE reference spatial data sets.</skos:definition>

The reporting on RBD, human activity and economy is called Article 5 report and was due for each RBD on 22/12/2004, with a summary sent to the Commission 3 month later. The Commission has agreed with MS to have an Electronic Reporting in WISE in 2006. The reporting is based on guidance documents elaborated under the Common Implementation Strategy (CIS), see especially IMPRESS, WATECO, GIS and Groundwater in Drinking Water Protected Areas on the WFD CIRCA library (https://circabc.europa.eu/w/browse/a3c92123-1013-47ff-b832-16e1caaafc9a). A Water Information System for Europe (WISE) and an Electronic Reporting Tool should also help the reporting. A guidance document including Reporting Sheets for 2005 Reporting was elaborated  to adapt the reporting to these needs.

The Commission letter launching this reporting exercise sets out the reference years for reporting (2008-2010) and provides the background of the main reporting requirements. The letter is available at http://icm.eionet.europa.eu/announcements          

The support files consist of help (guidance) documents, schemas, Excel spreadsheets, etc.
Drinking Water User Manual v1.0 provides support to the workflow for the DWD reporting and explains the main reporting steps for reporting information to the Commission in Reportnet. 
A common structure to be used in the reporting was agreed in May 2007. The guidance document has been revised and divided into Guidance Document on reporting and Guidance Document on derogations. It presents a new, table-oriented way of reporting, in line with DWD and with the WISE approach for reporting.
Schemas are developed to supply DWD reporting on the basis of the revised guidance document. Excel spreadsheets are used to import and structure MS data into the required format for the generation of the XML files. 

Additional information related to DWD is available on DG ENV website    http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-drink/reporting_en.htmlDirective 98/83/EC has repealed Directive 80/778/EC with effect from five years after the entry into force (i.e. on 25.12.2003).

 The development and adoption of the new reporting format for CMS Parties was a component of the CMS Information Management Plan (IMP).  The IMP aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of CMS implementation, and to ensure an effective contribution by CMS to harmonised reporting and information management by biodiversity-related treaties.  A draft of the IMP was presented at the Sixth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (November 1999) (document UNEP/CMS/Conf. 6.7 and Addendum), which issued Resolution 6.5 to provide recommendations and instructions on the implementation of the IMP.  To date, implementation of the IMP comprises three principal components: 1) the synthesis of Party Reports; 2) the new reporting format; and 3) the CMS Information Management System (CMS IMS).  The CMS IMS brings together information from Party reports, knowledge generated within CMS and other biodiversity agreements, and data from various expert organisations.  It is available on the CMS website (www.unep-wcmc.org/cms).

The information provided by Contracting Parties in the RIS is used as the basis for entering data and information into the Ramsar Sites Database, with management on behalf of the Ramsar Convention by Wetlands International under contract from the Ramsar Bureau.  The database is managed so as to provide an information service on Ramsar sites, including undertaking analysis and reporting to meetings of the Conference of the Parties on progress in implementing the Strategic Framework and Vision for the List of Wetlands of International Importance (Resolution VII.11) and other Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties.

The information provided by Parties in the RIS, including any supplementary information provided, and held in the Ramsar Sites Database is also used by Wetlands International to compile the Ramsar Sites Directory for each meeting of the Conference of the Parties.  The Directory provides a publicly-accessible standardised summary of the features and conservation status of each designated Ramsar site, and is also available on the Wetlands International website (www.wetlands.org).

To avoid redundancy and repetition in successive reports, it is suggested that a format be adopted for the first report submitted by each Party and a more succinct format be used for subsequent reports.  Moreover, a slightly different format is suggested for reports to be submitted by Parties that do not border on the area of the Agreement.

The format will be amended at the end of each Meeting of the Parties in order to take into account Resolutions adopted by the Meeting of the Parties.  

The report is to be submitted in English or French, in triplicate, and accompanied by an electronic version on floppy disk or CD-Rom.

It is recommended that Parties consult, as appropriate, with relevant non-governmental organisations and others with technical expertise in the preparation of national reports.

The electronic version of each report received will be available on the Agreement's website.Resolution 1.8 instructs the Second Meeting of the Parties to review the national reporting format in the light of experience gained from the submission of the first national reports and, if necessary, recommend changes to the format.

Annual report should contain a summary of the following information: (i) the number and type of permits and certificates granted;  (ii) the States with which trade in specimens of species included in Appendices I, II and III occurred; (iii) the numbers or quantities and types of specimens and the names of species as included in Appendices I, II and III; and (iv) the size and sex of the specimens in question, where appropriate.

Information from the annual reports is fed into the database maintained for the CITES Secretariat by UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC).  This database provides the basis for reports to various fora, comparative trade analysis, the review of significant trade, quota management, the identification of Parties with high trade volumes under the National Legislation Project, and assessment of overall compliance with and enforcement of the Convention.  CITES trade data is publicly available and specific requests for information should be directed to UNEP-WCMC (www.unep-wcmc.org).

Art 11(3):  Each Contracting Party shall inform the Standing Committee of the species receiving complete protection on its territory and not included in Appendices I and II.The Emerald Network is a network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCIs), which is to be established in the territory of the Contracting Parties and Observer States to the Bern Convention, including Central and Eastern European countries and the EU Member States.  For EU Member States, Emerald Network sites are those of Natura 2000.  Recommendation No. 16 (1989) defines ASCIs as those designated by states where that area fits one or several of the following conditions: 1) it contributes substantially to the survival of threatened species, endemic species, or any species listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention; 2) it suppose significant numbers of species in an area of high species diversity or supports important populations of one or more species; 3) it contains an important and/or representative sample of endangered habitat types; 4) it contains an outstanding example of a particular habitat type or a mosaic of different habitat types; 5) it represents an important area for one or more migratory species; or 6) it otherwise contributes significantly to the achievement of the objectives of the Convention.  The Emerald Network finds its legal basis in the Bern Convention, in particular Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9.  Several resolutions and recommendations of the Standing Committee to the Bern Convention give more precise indications on the role and mechanisms for the Emerald Network, including Recommendations Nos. 14, 15 and 16 (1989), Recommendation No. 25 (1991), Resolution No. 3 (1996), Resolution No. 4 (1996), Resolution No. 6 (1998) and Resolution No. 5 (1998).

a)to reduce pollution loads from the leather industry Best Available Technologies as per examples listed in Appendix 1, should be selectively applied. It is essential to reduce the volume of waste water discharges through, i.a., a specific water consumption reduction to a maximum rate of 50 m3/t input hide;

b)waste water discharges into either water bodies or municipal sewerage systems should be treated using optional waste water treatment processes, examples of which are listed in Appendix 2;
c)the limit values for waste water discharges from the leather industry into water bodies or municipal sewerage systems should not exceed the following values:

Crtot -0.075 kg/t input hide as annual mean and 1.5 mg/l Cr as 24 h-value or shorter sampling period

CODCr -20 kg/t input hide as annual mean for discharges to water bodies and for discharges into sewerage systems which are not connected to municipal treatment plants

tot-N -8 kg /t input hide as annual mean for discharges to water bodies and for discharges into sewerage systems which are not connected to municipal treatment plants

Internationally accepted standardized sampling, analysing and quality assurance methods (e.g. CEN-standards, ISO-standards and OECD-Guidelines) should be used whenever available;

This Protocol, which replaces the Protocol concerning Mediterranean Specially Protected Areas of 1982 in accordance with its Article 32, entered into force on 12 December 1999. The Annexes to the Protocol were adopted on 24 November 1996 by the Meeting of Plenipotentiaries on the Annexes to the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean, held in Monaco.

The SPA &amp; Biodiversity Protocol aims to protect marine areas which are important for the safeguard of the natural resources and natural sites of the Mediterranean Sea Area, as well as for the safeguard of cultural heritage in the region. Consequently, it provides for the designation and management of Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">At its eleventh session, the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) decided that its programme of work would be organised on the basis of seven two-year cycles, with each cycle focusing on selected thematic clusters of issues. The annual reports are prepared on the status of each Party's implementation of Agenda 21 in relation to the specific themes under discussion at that year's CSD meeting. Guidelines are developed by the CSD to assist countries in the preparation of these national annual reports.
With its fourteenth session (May 2006), the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) begins the second cycle of its multi-year programme of work, focusing on four main thematic issues: atmosphere, climate change, energy and industry. As in each cycle, the thematic clusters of issues will be addressed in an integrated manner, taking into account economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. 

National reports should be submitted in one of the UN's six official languages. (National reports are available on the CSD website but are only available in English, French or Spanish, and no translations are available.) The reports should be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Word), by e-mail or by mailing the diskette.For each reporting cycle a special focus on selected thematic clusters of issues is made:

[Reporting cycles' years: thematic cluster]: 2004/2005: Water; Sanitation; Human settlements; 2006/2007: Energy for Sustainable Development; Industrial Development; Air Pollution/Atmosphere; Climate Change; 2008/2009: Agriculture; Rural Development; Land; Drought; Desertification; Africa; 2010/2011: Transport; Chemicals; Waste Management; Mining; A Ten Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; 2012/2013: Forests; Biodiversity; Biotechnology; Tourism; Mountains; 2014/2015: Oceans and Seas; Marine Resources; Small Island Developing States; Disaster Management and Vulnerability; 2016/17: Overall appraisal of implementation of Agenda 21, the Programme of Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.</skos:definition>

The wildlife questionnaire is currently being reviewed. The review is closely linked to progress made with work on biodiversity indicators carried out with other international partners, in support of the OECD Environmental Strategy adopted by environment ministers of OECD countries in May 2001.  This work is ongoing.  Consequently the wildlife section of the questionnaire will not be revised in time for the next submission of the questionnaire in March 2004, and the 2002 version of the questionnaire will be used.

In terms of submission, an electronic version of the questionnaire should be submitted with the hard copy. When the questionnaire is sent out for completion, key tables are pre-filled on the basis of previous national replies and of subsequent data treatment.  Data should be provided for all years and periods requested, or for other appropriate dates in order to be able to analyse trends.  Countries are requested to provide comments necessary to the interpretation of the data, and to provide supplementary documentation where possible.  Explanatory notes are provided.Information and environmental data obtained from the Joint Questionnaire is used and published by the OECD in the Compendium of Environment Data, which is a regular OECD publication that is compiled every two years.  The Compendium has been published since 1985 and aims at presenting the best internationally available data on the environment and related areas. It was last published in 2003.  OECD also uses the data to update its database (SIREN).  For Eurostat and countries of the EU, the questionnaire provides data for related Eurostat and EEA publications and for ongoing work on environmental indicators.  The data will also contribute at international level to the work of the European Commission on environmental policies.

For Art 24, reporting on monitoring compliance is in fact a questionnaire sent by the Commission directly via e-mail to the Member States' competent authorities for biocidal products. It does not exist on-line. It's purpose is to provide the Commission with comprehensive information on compliance monitoring and also to give the Member States' reports the same structure, making the information easier to process for the sake need of the Commission composite report.Member States shall take the necessary arrangements for biocidal products which have been placed on the market to be monitored, to establish whether they comply with the requirements of this Directive, especially as regards effects on water, soil, air and fauna.
Every three years after 14/05/2000, Member States shall forward to the Commission by 30 November of the third year, a report on their action in these matters together with information on any poisonings involving biocidal products. For the first reporting a questionnaire was sent by the Commission to the Member States' designated authorities for guidance purposes. The report for the first period can be found on http://ec.europa.eu/environment/biocides/implementation.htm</skos:definition>

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The document aims at providing guidance to countries and assists them in the process of developing, reviewing and updating their NIPs. The Convention makes it clear that NIPs should be developed to address the specific needs of each Party. This document therefore is not intended to be prescriptive and should be used, in whole or in part, to contribute to the successful development of a NIP.  This latest edition complements the earlier editions by addressing the review and updating of a NIP and, in particular, taking into account the need to do so due to changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention in May 2009, April 2011, April 2013 and May 2015 to include 14 new chemicals in its Annexes A, B, and C. It also strengthens linkages with the Basel Convention and broader national chemicals management efforts. The guidance will be further revised as needed to take account of issues arising during its use in the field. 
To have a comprehensive overview, this guidance document should also be used as a companion to the whole set of NIP guidance documents.  </skos:definition>

Article 11 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) provides legally-binding requirements for Member States to establish and implement coordinated monitoring programmes for the ongoing assessment of the environmental status of marine waters. Member States are to notify the Commission under MSFD Article 11 of their monitoring programmes by 15 October 2014 so that the Commission can assess whether the elements notified constitute an appropriate framework to meet the requirements of the Directive.

All data files (reports) should be uploaded to ReportNet (http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/) (CDR). Under each Member State, a folder ‘Marine Strategy Framework Directive: monitoring programmes' has been created under the European Union (EU) obligations. Within each Member State folder, the following subfolders (sub-collections) are available to upload the files:
a. One sub-collection folder for any text-based national 'paper' reports for Article 11 (to be submitted in pdf format)and if applicable the copy (snapshot) of information held in a web-based data system or other website ( if linked to in the tabular data).
b. One sub-collection folder for geographic data if required  (i.e. an updated MSFD4Geo ML file and the associated geographic data (spatial data in grid or non-grid polygon format).
c. One sub-collection folder for each Marine region and/or sub-region relevant to the Member State's marine waters, for uploading tabular data (i.e. the xml schemas for Article 11).

 http://circa.europa.eu/Members/irc/dsis/envir/library?l=/joint_questionnaire_4/jointsquestionnaires2004&amp;vm=detailed&amp;sb=Title
  
The Data Collection Manual for the OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire on Inland Waters Tables 1 – 7 (Version 2.3, September 2010) is made to help the filling of the various tables of the questionnaire. The manual is also available in protected Joint Questionnaire CIRCA site at  http://circa.europa.eu/Members/irc/dsis/envir/library?l=/joint_questionnaire_4/jointsquestionnaires2004_2/2008_jq/manuals&amp;vm=detailed&amp;sb=Title  

Both the questionnaire and the manual undergo changes/adaptations from one reporting exercise to the next (clarifications, eliminations of errors, sometimes additions of new variables, re-structuring of tables etc).  

All countries are requested to send their replies via eDAMIS, Eurostat's single entry point for reporting. Respective instructions have been supplied to all NSI (National Statistical Institutes) of ESS (European Statistical System) countries. 

The questionnaire is based on clearly defined tables including definitions and formats requested. It consists of data and textual information (footnotes).There is no specific legal base for this questionnaire – it is voluntary reporting (gentlemen's agreement), but there is an indirect obligation as EU countries have approved in Parliament and Council the 5y Statistical Programme and the annual work programmes. In addition, EFTA countries are as well members of the ESS (European Statistical System) and have approved the programmes in the respective governing body SPC (now called ESS Committee). EU candidate countries have to demonstrate their statistical capabilities in the course of their preparation for accession.

The data, as far as validated by Eurostat, are publicly accessible on Eurostat's Database (available at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database), then go to theme "Environment and energy". Eurostat also presents and explains selected water statistics on its Wikistyle Website "Statistics Explained" at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Water_statistics        
Parts of the data are used for publications (Statistical Yearbook, Key Figures on Europe).</skos:definition>

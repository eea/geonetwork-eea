Landscape fragmentation Effective Mesh Size;eea_landscape-fragmentation-mesh-size_s;This data is the basis of the indicator for assessing landscape fragmentation due to urban and transport expansion, considering major roads only. The computation is based on the method of Effective Mesh Size. The effective mesh size (meff) can be interpreted as the area that is accessible to animals when starting a movement at a randomly chosen point inside a landscape without encountering a physical barrier. The meff expresses the probability that any two points chosen randomly in an area are connected, that is, not separated by the barriers of a Fragmentation Geometry (FG) such as transport routes or built-up areas. Hence, meff is a measure of landscape connectivity, i.e. the degree to which movements between different parts of the landscape are possible. The meff is measured as an area (km2), within the cells of a 1 km2 regular grid as reporting units.;4a038ec2-f132-485e-a8e7-bc1043d8ca2f,53bb9d36-0e28-4486-aa06-dc488671c84e

To date, power generation remains the largest GHG-emitting sector in Europe. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is by far the most commonly-emitted GHG across the sector, being a product of combustion processes. An almost complete decarbonisation of the EU’s electricity sector is needed in order to meet the EU’s objective of becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.;eea-data-and-maps-data-co2-intensity-of-electricity-generation

Estimated effects of increased RES consumption since 2005 on fossil fuels and GHG emissions;eea_estimated-effects-fossil-fuels-ghg-emissions_s;Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion and use of energy from renewable sources commits the EU to achieving a 20 % share of renewable energy sources (RES) in its gross final energy consumption by 2020 and a 10 % share of renewable energy in transport energy consumption by the same year. Article 22 of the directive requires Member States to report on national progress in the promotion and use of energy from renewable sources, biennially, starting with 31 December 2011. It specifies that the national reports shall contain, inter alia, the estimated net GHG emission savings due to the use of energy from renewable sources.#Information regarding the specific methodologies used by the countries for producing the above estimates of net GHG emission savings is not always available. To that end, the EEA and its European Topic Centre for Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM) produce each year a consistent set of estimated co-benefits, at the Member State and EU level, concerning the impact on fossil fuels and GHG emissions due to the increase in RES consumption since 2005.

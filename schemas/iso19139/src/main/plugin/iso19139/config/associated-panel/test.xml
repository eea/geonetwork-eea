  <p>Information is reported for the zones designated under the ambient air quality directives (2008/50/EC;
    2004/107/EC). Member States have to divide their entire territory into zones. Zones can be regarded as the primary
    territorial units for assessment and management of air quality under the air quality directives. Consequently,
    unambiguous definition of all zones is needed. Member States have employed different approaches for the definition
    of their zones. Some Member States have divided their territory into a single set of zones serving all pollutants.
    Other Member States have defined a single base set of zones and modified some of the zones for the application to
    particular pollutants. Where a Member State has distinguished different sets of zones in relation to health
    protection and ecosystem/vegetation protection respectively, a single location can be situated in several zones,
    e.g. in a zone defined for all pollutants except lead and in another, larger zone defined for lead.</p>^M

  <p>Pursuant to Article 22 of Directive 2008/50/EC, Member States may notify to the Commission when in their opinion
    the conditions are met in a given zone or agglomeration for postponing the attainment deadline for the limit values
    for nitrogen dioxide and benzene, or for being exempt from the limit values for PM10. More information is available
